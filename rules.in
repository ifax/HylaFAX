# Common makefile rules.
#
# - After including defs, a makefile should say
#   ``include ${COMMONRULES}'' to get this file.
# - It is up to the including makefile to define a default rule before
#   including ${COMMONRULES}.
# - This file defines the following lists: SOURCES, enumerating all
#   source files; OBJECTS, the .o files derived from compilable source;
#   and DIRT, which lists intermediates and temporary files to be
#   removed by clean.
# - The including (parent) makefile may define source file lists for each
#   standard suffix: CFILES for .c, etc.  This file combines all such
#   lists into SOURCES.
# - The parent makefile must define TARGETS in order for clobber to work.
#

OBJECTS= ${C++FILES:.c++=.o} ${CFILES:.c=.o}
