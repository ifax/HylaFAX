The file $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is not present.  This
probably means the machine has not been setup using the faxsetup(@MANNUM1_8@)

# tiffcheck looks over a TIFF document and prints out a string
# that describes what's needed (if anything) to make the file
# suitable for transmission with the specified parameters (page
# width, page length, resolution, encoding).  This string may
# be followed by explanatory messages that can be returned to
# the user.  The possible actions are:
#
# OK		document is ok
# REJECT	something is very wrong (e.g. not valid TIFF)
# REFORMAT	data must be re-encoded
# REVRES	reformat to change vertical resolution
# RESIZE	scale or truncate the pages
# REIMAGE	image is not 1-channel bilevel data
#
# Note that these actions may be combined with "+";
# e.g. REFORMAT+RESIZE.  If we cannnot do the necessary work
# to prepare the document then we reject it here.

    #    the job submission process.
    # 2) We don't use symbolic links because the links get broken
    #    when the source document is shared between jobs and
    #    faxq removes the source document before all jobs complete.

    # If we ever encounter problems where the client submits corrupt
    # TIFF and we need to clean it up before transmission, then we
    # can simply merge OK with REFORMAT.  For now we use $CP instead
    # of $TIFFCP, however, to provide the client some control.
