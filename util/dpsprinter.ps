%%Title: dpsprinter.ps -- DPS prolog to emulate some printer features.

%
% This file makes a number of definitions that are technically system specific
% but are used by many existing PostScript language drivers that were written
% without sufficient attention to the specification.
% 
% This prolog ensures that serverdict, exitserver, and assorted statusdict 
% operators are defined as expected.  The flushfile operator is also redefined
% to allow Macintosh files with a prepended Laser Prep file to work properly.
% 
% There is one special "feature" definition.  The ASCII character \004
% (CTRL-D) is defined as a no-op operator in case the prolog contains
% one to indicate end-of-file in some contexts.

% The Mac Laser Prep file executes the flushfile operator to get to the end
% of the prolog.  When documents are saved with the prolog attached, the
% flushfile consumes the document and nothing is printed.  To get around this
% problem the definition of flushfile is changed below to consume bytes of
% input until a PostScript language comment (%) character is found.  The
% rest of the line is then consumed before the revised flushfile terminates.
