# We need to process the arguments to extract the input
# files so that we can prepend a prologue file that defines
# LaserWriter-specific stuff as well as to insert and error
# handler that generates ASCII diagnostic messages when
# a problem is encountered in the interpreter.

# NB: this shell script is assumed to be run from the
#     top of the spooling hierarchy -- s.t. the etc directory
#     is present.

FATAL ERROR: $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is missing!

The file $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is not present.  This
probably means the machine has not been setup using the faxsetup(@MANNUM1_8@)
command.  Read the documentation on setting up HylaFAX before you
startup a server system.

The DPS-based PostScript RIP does not exist on the server machine
or is not located at the expected location:

    $PS

This indicates that you do not have hylafax.sw.dpsrip installed on
the system or that it is installed in a nonstandard location.  This
must be corrected before a PostScript document can be transmitted.

The DPS-based PostScript RIP is a COFF executable and cannot be used
under IRIX $OS.  You must use a different RIP such as hylafax.sw.gsrip
which is based on the freely distributed Ghostscript software distribution.
