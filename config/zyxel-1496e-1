# Class 1 configuration for a ZyXEL U1496.  Class 1
# support was introduced in firmware revision 6.14.
#
# This configuration file sets up the ZyXEL to run at 38.4 for
# both sending and receiving.  RTS/CTS flow control is used on
# the tty port by default.

# We normally append the "@" symbol to the dial string so that
# the modem will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect
# and return result codes that distinguish between no carrier
# and no answer.  This makes it possible to avoid problems with
# repeatedly dialing a number that doesn't have a fax machine
# (kudos to Stuart Lynne for this trick.)
#
# Unfortunately, ZyXEL's don't seem to detect a busy signal when
# the @ symbol is used to terminate the dialing string.  Instead
# calls to a busy line come back with a NO CARRIER status which
# causes us to toss the job.  Consequently we fall back to the
# normal method and raise the number of retries on a no carrier
# status.  ZyXEL claims that this behaviour is not a bug, but 
# rather that we are requesting ``an enhancement'' (never mind
# that their manual says that it should work).
