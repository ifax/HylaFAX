# Some firmwares do not report copy quality correction, although it

# Some firmware revisions (i.e. 1.25 in ZBAs) report MMR support but
# corrupt the data.  Enabling the following lines should work around this.
# Compare this against the modem's AT+FCC=? response.

# If your modem supports ECM you may want to do something like this

# Or with the MT5634ZBA-DID you'll probably need something like...
# QualifyCID:		etc/cid		# you must create this file
# ModemResetCmds:	AT*DS1*DD0*DF1	# enable DTMF-DID
# CIDNumber:		"DTMF"		# format of AT*DF1
# CIDNumberAnswerLength:	4	# four DTMF-DID digits then ATA
