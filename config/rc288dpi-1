# Configuration for a Rockwell RC288DPi-based Class 1 modem.
#    Hayes Optima 28800		firmware rev ???
#    Microcom DeskPorte 28.8S	firmware rev V1.100K-V34_DS
#    PPI PM288FXMT		firmware rev 1.57
#
# Note that the modem does not lock the line rate for fax
# receive (at least not the PM288FXMT); but not sure whether
# current flow control settings are maintained or if it
# switches to XON/XOFF (testing host was too fast to see).
