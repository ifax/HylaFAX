# Some firmwares do not report copy quality correction, although it

# unfortunately, HylaFAX can't currently send or receive in color
# Also, the modem's extended resolution support is buggy

# Some firmware revisions (i.e. 1.25) report MMR support but corrupt the data.
# Some firmware revisions (i.e. 1.25 and 1.28) report extended resolution support but
# have trouble with 300x300 and 400x400 resolutions and corrupt DIS for inch resolutions.
# Enabling the following lines should work around these things.
# Compare this against the modem's AT+FCC=? response.

# If your modem supports ECM you may want to do something like this 
# Class2Cmd:		AT+FCLASS=2.1;+FRY=4

# If your line supports Caller-ID, you may want to uncomment this...
# ModemResetCmds:	AT+VCID=1
# CallIDPattern:	"NMBR="
# CallIDPattern:	"NAME="

# Or with the MT5634ZBA-DID you'll probably need something like...
# ModemReadyCmds:	AT*DS1*DD0*DF1*DN4	# enable DTMF-DID, wink-start, 4 digits
# CallIDPattern:	"DTMF"		# format of AT*DF1
# CallIDAnswerLength:	4		# four DTMF-DID digits then ATA
