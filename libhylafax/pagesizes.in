# HylaFAX Page Size Database
#
# This file defines the set of known page sizes.  Note that the name is
# matched using a caseless comparison.  Most of the guaranteed reproducible
# areas are guesses based on scaling known GRA's.
#
# File format:
#
# 1. Comments are introduced by '#' and continue to the end of line.
# 2. The first two fields are the full and abbreviated page size names
#    and must be separated from the subsequent fields by a tab (possibly
#    followed by more whitespace).  Otherwise fields can be separated
#    by any amount of any kind of whitespace.
# 3. Numbers are all base 10 and in basic measurement units (BMU);
#    defined as 1/1200 x 25.4 mm for paper output with a scale factor
#    of one.
# 4. All fields must be present on a single line; otherwise the entry
#    is ignored.
# 5. Most all users of this database require a "default" entry that
#    specifies the default page size to use.  This entry should be placed
#    last so that inverse matches find the real page size name and not
#    the default entry.
