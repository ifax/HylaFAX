And now, a note from HylaFAX's original author ;-)

  Silicon Graphics has seen fit to allow me to give this work away.  It
  is free.  There is no support or guarantee of any sort as to its
  operations, correctness, or whatever.  If you do anything useful with
  all or parts of it you need to honor the copyright notices.   I would
  also be interested in knowing about it and, hopefully, be
  acknowledged.

  Finally, note that this software is called ``HylaFAX'', not
  ``Hylafax'', ``hylafax'', and certainly not ``FlexFAX'' (the old name
  which someone else has a copyright on).  If you want to refer to this
  software use ``HylaFAX (tm)'' and be sure to honor the Silicon
  Graphics trademark.
